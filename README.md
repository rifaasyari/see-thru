## Introduction

Current pose detection methods use a camera, which is not privacy-friendly. Other methods require a sensor to be strapped onto the user, which are uncomfortable and limit the users movement. We want to develop a method that can aquire accurate pose-data with radar data, which is privacy friendly and does not have to have contact with the user.

## Notes

Pose detection method: MediaPipe Poses

Match Tp(pose) with Tr(radar) if dt < 0.067
